# SayingWelcome: A Multi-Paradigm Python Educational Repository

## 📖 Description

**SayingWelcome** is an educational Python repository designed to demonstrate how to solve the same simple programming task using three different programming paradigms: **Procedural**, **Functional**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. 

The core task is straightforward: **Take a user's name as input and display a personalized welcome message.** While simple, this task serves as an excellent vehicle for exploring fundamental programming concepts and Python best practices across different paradigms and skill levels.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This repository helps learners understand:
- **Programming Paradigms**: How different paradigms approach problem-solving
- **Code Progression**: How code evolves from beginner to advanced implementations
- **Python Best Practices**: PEP 8, PEP 257, type hints, and clean code principles
- **Code Readability**: The importance of documentation and meaningful naming
- **Scalability**: How simple programs can be structured for maintainability

## 💡 Programming Paradigms Explained
### 🔄 Procedural Programming
- Focuses on procedures or routines
- Sequential execution of instructions
- Uses functions to organize code
- Emphasizes step-by-step problem solving

### 🧮 Functional Programming
- Treats computation as evaluation of functions
- Avoids changing state and mutable data
- Uses pure functions and function composition
- Emphasizes immutability and expressiveness

### 🏛️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Organizes code around objects and classes
- Emphasizes encapsulation and abstraction
- Uses inheritance and polymorphism
- Models real-world entities and relationships

## 📈 Skill Levels
### 🟢 Beginner
- Simple, readable implementations
- Basic error handling
